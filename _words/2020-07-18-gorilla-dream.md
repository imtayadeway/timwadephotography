....in which i am at home when a man in a gorilla suit rings the doorbell...i can see them through the clear glass of the door...i am busy doing something, perhaps on the phone to a friend, but i try to indicate that i want them to go away by gesturing...he does so, but returns shortly...he has something for me...i dismiss him again, but he keeps coming back...i become afraid and try to yell at him to go away, as i seem to remember this happening before as a child in a clairvoyant dream, but i am unable to make the sounds, as if paralyzed, and he persists...my fear intensifies and i am eventually able to wrest myself by shouting out, unintelligibly, go away! go away!...
